# Tom Cagnoni Website

* Worked for another client to produce this website showcasing his musical talents. 

* He provided me with only the content and gave me the freedom to come up with a design.

* Built and deployed using React function components with state.

* Utilised useState hook mostly to deal with the responsive nav menu but also to implement some other visual features.

* Also features smooth scrolling and active nav menu links. 

* With considerable content including text, images and videos, I had to give the layout lots of thought and come up with a design which works well for all screen sizes.
